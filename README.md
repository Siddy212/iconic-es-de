## **Configuration Options**

- This theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - `16:9`
   - `16:10`
   - `4:3`
   - `19.5:9`
   - `1:1`
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games.  `Simple` variants will have a minimal System view without overlays and reduce the amount of metadata shown. All settings will scale the size of the gamelist and the amount of metadata shown based on the selected font size. `X-Large` font will disable metadata and show only the boxart for Textlist/Carousel views.:
   - `Textlist` - A simple list of game names on the right with the miximage on the left. 

   - `Carousel` - A vertical carousel of game marquees on the right and the game miximage on the left.

   - `Grid: Boxart` - A grid view that displays boxart covers with metadata on the left.

   - `(Simple) Carousel` - Simple System view. A vertical carousel of game marquees on the right and minimal metadata on the left.  

   - `(Simple) Carousel Horizontal` - Simple System view. A horizontal carousel of game boxart with minimal metadata below.

   - `(Simple) Grid: Physical Media` - Simple System view. A grid view that spands the entire width of the screen and displays physical media.

     
- `Theme Color Scheme` - There are 3 types of color schemes that are used for the overall theme on all views, Light, Dark, and Retro-Gray.  Each of these color schemes allow you to choose from: Classic, Modern, or Custom. This will indicate which art style to use.

   - `Dark` - A dark scheme in Classic, Modern, or Custom styles.
   - `Retro Gray` - A SNES inspired color scheme in Classic, Modern, or Custom styles.

   - `Medium` - good for display on tvs and computer monitors. Medium Grid sizing.

## **Theme Customizations**

This theme allows customizations to artwork without the need to edit the source XML.  This enables you to change the look of the theme and still retain any changes when the root theme is updated.

### Start Here 
- Make sure `Light (Custom Artwork)`, `Dark (Custom Artwork)`, or `Retro Gray (Custom Artwork)`  is selected from `Menu > UI Settings > Theme Variant`
- This setting changes the directories that the theme looks for artwork in and sets up the ability for you to add custom artwork.
- If desired, users can mix and match classic/modern art. There is also an alternate background/overlay folder that can give additional options.

### Backgrounds
- Use the folder called `custom-backgrounds` in ES-DE's theme directory at: `ES-DE/themes/iconic-es-de/_inc/systems`
- Copy your custom background images to that folder
- They should be named:
    - ${system.theme}.webp
    - _default.webp
- `${system.theme}.webp` should be named for the system you are looking to override.  For example if you wanted to override the artwork for `snes` you would create an image called `snes.webp` in the backgrounds folder.
- If a given ${system.theme}.webp image is not found, it will use _default.jpg image, so make sure to keep that file.
  
### Overlays
- Custom overlays can be added to help make images pop. These are only active in non-"Simple" variants.
- These should be in a 16:9 1920x1080 aspect ratio and a transparent .webp format to have the desired effect.
- Use the folder called `custom-overlay` in ES-DE's theme directory at: `ES-DE/themes/iconic-es-de/_inc/systems`
- Upload your custom overlay images to that folder. Be aware that these will appear on top of all other assets on that screen.
- They should be named:
    - ${system.theme}.webp

## **Additional Notes**

This theme may be resource intensive due to the layering of images. This is especially true when utilizing the grid view or the non-"Simple" variants. Increasing the VRAM limit under "Other Settings" within the ES-DE menu is useful if pop-in is experienced.
